          Hello! My name is Shivam and I enjoy building web apps. My journey in
          programming started from class 11. During that time, "Computer science
          with Python" was the additional subject which I had to do during the
          curriculum. This sparked my interest in programming world.
          <br />
          <br />
          Fast forward to today, I've learnt a thing or two in both frontend and
          backend side of the web development. Currently, my main focus is to
          get hands on experience in the industry and learn about the best
          practices regarding professional programming and development.
